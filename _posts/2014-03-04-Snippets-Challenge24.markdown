The Challenge 24 Solver is a Python solution to the [grade school math game]. It uses recursion to find all the possible solutions for 4 numbers to equal 24 using +,-,*,/. It also generates all of the solutions for all combinations between 1-24.

Laura, a full grown adult, is pretty good at the game. I printed out the entire solution set and gave it to her for her birthday. Now we don't have to play anymore. 

Something like this...
