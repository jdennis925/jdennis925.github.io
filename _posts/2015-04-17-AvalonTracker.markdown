The Avalon Tracker is a app that logs how you and your friends play in the 'social deduction game' [The Resistance Avalon]

After field testing the concept, it works only if all of the players are able to interact on the tablet device. Giving all of the logging responsibility to one player makes it difficult to play the game.
