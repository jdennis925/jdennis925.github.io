Laura and I are inspried by this [538 Riddler Classic] to find the largest chain of factors and multiples from 1-n. I tell her our code has O(n!) runtime. She is not phased.

Example chain for n = 100
```
4, 12, 24, 6, 60, 30, 10, 100, 25, 5, 1, 97
```

For n = 10 the longest chain length is 9. Our code finds this solution rather quickly.
```
4, 8, 1, 5, 10, 2, 6, 3, 9
```

We're still waiting on the results for n = 100... (but not really)
